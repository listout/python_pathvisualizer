# Path finding with Python and Pygame

This is a personal project

##### This code was taken from `Tech With Tim`'s Path visualizing tutorial. [His Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A)

Requirements:

+ Python
+ Pygame

For now I have only achieved till `bfs`. I hope to add more algorithms along the way.
